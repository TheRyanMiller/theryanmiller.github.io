##Looking back on 2016
I've spent 28 years on this earth, and I can say without hesitation that 2016 has been my best. I'm not just making this claim because I happen to feel good today, but I have a lot of supporting evidence to prove it. Without going into too much detail, I have finally gotten comfortable in my job role at work leading development of several software projects, and building tools that genuinely help people on a day to day basis. I have also self-learned Java programming and Android development and put [my first app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rtmillerprojects.sangitlive&hl=en) into the Google Play Store.  

This year did not come without its failures and struggles. But to keep focus on the bright side - I'd say the over-arching headline for my year was the importance of _**follow-through**_. Learning brand new things does not come free or without effort. And this year, more-so than any other, I feel that I've a better job of setting specific, challenging goals and sticking to them until completion even through times of hopelessness. _And that_ is a large part of my motivation for this blog post: Being intentional about what I want to do in 2017 will help me make progress in some of my larger goals in life.

##2017 New Year Resolutions
I won't be sharing my personal resolutions here, but I do want to share my approach for developing them because, starting with this year, I want to take my new year's resolutions more seriously. Although January 1st is quite an arbitrary date, there is a bit of psychological momentum and "clean slate" feeling that I'm trying to eek out. I'm looking to take a more analytic approach to how I select my goals and how I might organize and prioritize them to make the biggest long-term impact on my life. But just setting goals is not enough: A key ingredient is to develop a plan for achieving each goal. Without a plan, it's not easy to start. 

What I'm doing is making a list of areas of fulfillment and importance in my life - the facets of life that require maintenance and which hone well-roundedness. I have 12:  

Spirituality & Purpose  
Contribution & Impact  
Location & Tangibles  
Money & Finances  
Career & Work  
Character & Identity  
Health & Fitness  
Education & Skill Development  
Social Life & Relationships  
Emotional & Well-being  
Productivity & Organization  
Adventure & Creativity

A very important part of this exercise is simply to spend time reflecting on each of these categories to help pull out memories. Getting my brain to focus on reviewing these things now will help me to continue to draw out some ideas even over the course of a couple days which is fine. For the time being, the goal is to review each of these categories and determine how I performed or underperformed in 2016, and what lessons I learned that will help me adjust in 2017.

What went well?  
What did not go well?  
Do I feel good about my status here?  
What can I do specifically to improve or change?


Right away I recognize some areas that call for big improvement and have developed some ideas on how I might close that gap. I encourage folks to read [this guide by Alex Vermeer](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/) that breaks this exercise down even further.
