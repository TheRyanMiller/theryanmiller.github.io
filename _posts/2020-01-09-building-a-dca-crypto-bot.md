Starting a new project today. This one is to solve a need I've had for a while: I'd like automate a way to dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin over a long period of time. Coinbase offers recurring buys through coinbase.com, but charges higher transaction fees and less flexibility.  

I'd like to build a front-end, logging facilities, alerts, and construct a secure API.
  
Learning goals for this project:
- Secure APIs using JWT access token
- Learn TypeScript and the Coinbase Pro SDK
- Deploy to self-hosted server
- Setup PKI
