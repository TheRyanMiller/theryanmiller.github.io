##Project goals for 2017
Some of my goals for the new year are to pick up the Python language, make a more conscious effort to [read other peoples' code](https://changelog.com/posts/one-sure-fire-way-to-improve-your-coding), and to begin contributing to open source projects.  
I've done some brainstorming and browsing for project ideas and have a few candidates:  


- Mortgage calculator (Python)
- Bandwidth monitor to determine upload/download amount (Python)
-  Tagging for mp3 files (Python)
-  Open source Android ideas [great reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5lqdvw/do_you_want_to_contribute_to_an_open_source_app/)
