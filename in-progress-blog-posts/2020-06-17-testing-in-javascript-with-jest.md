# A Foray into Javascript Testing with Jest

*This blog post is incomplete. But I will be getting back to it soon!*

`npm i jest --save-dev` command to tell npm you just want this package to be used only in DEV
once jest is installed  

Naming convention for tests is to name the test file the same as file you want tested, but add a `.test.js` instead of simply `.js`. So for example, the test for `script.js` would be `script.test.js`   

Use `npm test` to test using jest
