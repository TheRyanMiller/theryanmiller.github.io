			Hi, I'm Ryan Miller. I like waking up early, drinking coffee, and being productive. I build software and enjoy building things that help other people.
    </br></br>The purpose of this site is to help motivate me to learn new things (including how to build this site using Jekyll â˜º), 
      force me to write more frequently (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }} blog.html">see my blog</a>), and hopefully meet people who are like-minded!
