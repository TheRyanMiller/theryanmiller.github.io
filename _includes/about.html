      Hi, I'm Ryan Miller. I work as an IT system integrator for The Boeing Company and
      enjoy building useful software on nights and weekends as a hobby. This website is where I plan to publish some 
      of my personal projects, photography, and write-ups about anything 
      interesting I learn along the way.
      I value an ability to communicate ideas - technical or not - and periodically try to publish to
       <a href="{{ site.baseurl }} blog.html">my blog</a> as a way to stay sharp.
